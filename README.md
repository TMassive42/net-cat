# net-cat

This project is a simple TCP chat server implementation in Go. It allows multiple clients to connect and chat with each other in a group.

## Features

- TCP connection between server and multiple clients
- Requirement for clients to provide a name
- Limit on the maximum number of concurrent connections (10)
- Clients can send messages to the chat
- Empty messages are not broadcasted
- Messages are formatted with timestamp, sender name, and message content
- New clients receive the chat history upon connection
- Clients are notified when another client joins or leaves the chat

## Prerequisites
